## Game Rules

Press the _Start_ button to begin the game.

The deck consists of an even number of cards, each card has a _match_ (an identical card). To make a move, open two cards. If they match, they will remain face up, otherwise they will flip face down. The goal is to find all matches in the least amount of time.

When all card match, you will see your time and your rating. The more moves you make to finish the game, the lower the rating.

To pause the current game, press _Pause_ button. To continue, press _Resume_. When all cards match, press _Restart_ to start a new game.

Enjoy the Matching Game!
